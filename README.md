# task1-elevatelabs
In this task I have learnt about how to format data, remove duplicates by using excel formulas and shortcuts.
I have used Ctrl+Shift+Down arrow and Alt+A+E to select and sort the CSV file into understandable format.
To remove duplucates Alt+A+M.
Freeze Title row
Shortcut to Format cell is Ctrl+1
For blank spaces I used the Find & Select -> Go to Special -> Enter some common value for all Blank rows -> Ctrl + Enter to fill the same value in all blank spaces.
For easy identification of unknown values I highlighted the cells.
